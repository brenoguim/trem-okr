1. OKRs have a hierarchy which is separate from the organization hierarchy (i.e. people). Any person can add a new Objective or Key Result.
    > This probably means:
    >
    > - KRs have to be children of Os or other KRs, and may only be parents of other KRs
    > - Os may only be children of other Os, and may be parents of Os and KRs
    >
    > We need a hierarchy (i.e. tree) to track both OKRs and teams, and OKR need to have both the creator (for tracking purposes) and the owner (which identifies the team)
2. Cross-team dependencies need to be visible
    > This probably means:
    > O/KRs can have relationships both upward/downward (i.e. contributes to/is contributed by) and forward/backward (i.e. helps/is helped by)
3. It has to be easy to update OKRs
    > Should be possible to do from anywhere: desktop, web, mobile... Let's start with web first :)
4. It has to display a chart of how OKRs are connected
    > Graph view and tree view, with zoom
5. It has to display a history of progress, with some color coding
    > What color coding?
6. It should encorage the user to update progress
    > Ease of use goes a long way. Maybe reminders?
7. It has to support colaboration
    > Comments are a good way
8. Examples of other companies who have adopted this
    > Not applicable to us
9. Licensing
    > Not applicable to us
10. Mobile support
    > Not applicable to us right now
11. OKR Grading
    > A way to say what percentage of the OKR is done. We can start with a hardcoded number first
12. Create report per individual or per OKRs
13. Key results should be measurable and have time frame
    > Probably highlight in red, maybe a checklist for OKRs best practices?
14. Coach/support
    > Not applicable to us
15. Types of KRs: (i.e. baseline metric, positive target metric, negative target metric, threshold target metric, and milestone)
    > This is about measurement of KRs. Think of a strategy that allows us to implement this in the future, like a knob to determine automatic measurement vs manual
16. Draft mode: enter "invisible" OKRs in the system
    > That is a good idea! Like the phases concept in hg
17. Authentication: SSO, Password
    > Not sure if this can be delayed, probably it can :)
18. Exporting/Importing data: Salesforce/Oracle/BI/other systems
19. Add/remove employee
20. History of OKRs: be able to go back
    > Normally OKRs are quarterly, but some companies have them per year/per semester. Not sure how to document this in the system: what is the validity of an OKR?
    >
    > This concept is needed for visualization, probably.
    >
    > Maybe we color OKRs according to their age?
21. "What type of information or metric is the tool capturing?"
22. Be usable by both individuals for project management and leaders for business management
23. Frequency of use/reporting
24. Assign status to KRs: "on track - green" "behind - red", or automatic derive status
